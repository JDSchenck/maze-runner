# maze-runner
[Java] A 2-D array constructed as a maze with open pathways and dead ends denoted by x's, is traversed and solved  using a stack data structure based algorithm.

Files:
MazeTester.java : Application/driver, initializes the 2-D array maze
Position.java : Class which defines current "position" as an object, keeps track of the current coordinates in the array during traversal
Maze.java : Algorithm --> traverse() method with stack data structure implementation for path tracing
README.md : Description of project files
